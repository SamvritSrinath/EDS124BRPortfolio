Following that I am currently serving as a tutor for CSE 100 **Advanced Data Structures** with Professor Niema Moshiri. I am also a CS Education Researcher exploring the usage of LLMs in the context of CS Education(primarily with introductory programming courses). This is in conjunction with UIUC's CS Education Research Group. We are submitting to ITICSE very soon :D.
